        <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p> - I picked images and content that matched what I wanted to use in my rankings and then I picked some images to match the movie theme. </p>
        <p> - There were no issues in my communication with my lead developer, and we mostly talked in class if she had a question.</p>
        <p> - Yes, my expectations were exceeded by the developers.</p>
        <p> - I wouldn't do anything differently next time because the project went very smoothly.</p>

        <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p> - I managed my team by communicating through a group chat where I assigend the child pages and answered any questions the junior developers had.</p>
        <p> - I talked to the client in class and made sure to get all the information I needed for the project. There were no issues in communication.</p>
        <p> - I published the site to the repository on GitHub and sent my client the link. </p>
        <p> - My experience using GitHiub was good and I had no issues and still learned a lot.</p>

        <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <p> - I communicated with my lead developers through Teams, and that's where the wireframe was dropped, and all the assignments.</p>
        <p> - Yes I knew what was expected for each page because the wireframes had all the information I needed.</p>
        <p> - I contributed to my sites by creating child pages for each lead developer.</p>
        <p> - I ran into no issues using GitHub and it was a good experience.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p> - This project wasn't super difficult but it had it's challenges. The biggest challenge was having to wait on others to finish things in order for me to continue. I overcame it by being patient and using Teams to find out when things were done.</p>
        <p> - My favorite part of the project was seeing everything come together at the end and being able to see the final product. I also enjoy doing CSS and making the pages look good.</p>
        <p> - The only thing I would do differently is to communicate better with my team leaders to know when and hoe they want things done.</p>
        <p> - I feel very confident to work on real world projects after this experience because I have used GitHub and worked with a team to create a final product.</p>
